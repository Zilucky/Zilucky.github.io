  <h2>Step 1: Identify the System You Will Be Modelling</h2>
  <p>Water treatment plants, mainly including water sources, water treatment equipment, pipe network systems, monitoring
    systems, HMI, PLC, etc.</p>
  <p>Security goals are to filter all harmful or detrimental substances out of the water.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Create a large initial set of possible threats by applying Security Cards</h2>
  <p>Appropriate security cards are applied according to the security needs of the water treatment plant and industry
    standards, and security cards are issued to three categories of participants as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>System users/Purchasers ：Operators, representatives of regulatory bodies, procurement departments, etc.</li>
    <li>System engineers/Developers：Process engineers, automation engineers, design engineers, systems engineers,
      architects, developers, etc.</li>
    <li>Cybersecurity experts：Network security analysts, security architects, security consultants, penetration testers.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Have the participants look over the cards along all four dimensions: human impact, adversary's motivations,
    adversary's resources, and adversary's methods.</p>

  <p>Let the participants consider the questions：</p>

  <ol>
    <li>If your system were compromised, what assets, both human and system, could be impacted?</li>
    <p>System users/purchasers:</p>
    <p>Operators: may be affected by system outages, operational errors or information leaks.</p>
    <p>Regulatory agency representatives: may result in regulatory targets not being met, water quality issues or
      compliance issues.</p>
    <p>Procurement departments: may be affected by supply chain disruptions, equipment damage or supplier information
      breaches.</p>
    <p>System engineers/developers:</p>
    <p>Process engineers: may lead to reduced process efficiency, water quality issues or equipment damage.</p>
    <p>Automation engineers: may result in automation system failures, control failures or information leaks.</p>
    <p>Design engineers: may be affected by system design flaws, equipment damage or confidential information leaks.</p>
    <p>Cybersecurity experts:</p>
    <p>Network security analysts: may result in network outages, data breaches or unauthorised access.</p>
    <p>Security Architect: May be affected by security architecture flaws, vulnerability exploits or malware attacks.
    </p>
    <p>Security consultants: May lead to security policy failures, threat intelligence leaks or unauthorised access.</p>

    <li>Who are the personae non gratae who might reasonably attack your system and why? </li>
    <p>What are their names/job titles/roles? Describe them in some detail:</p>
    <p>(1) What are their goals?</p>
    <p>(2) What resources and skills might the PnG have?</p>
    <p>Competitors or Business Adversaries: Other companies or competitors may try to gain access to your business
      secrets or disrupt your operations.</p>
    <p>(1) Objective: To steal confidential data, gain a commercial advantage or damage your reputation.</p>
    <p>(2) Resources and skills: Competitive knowledge, technology and resources that may attack systems using hacking
      techniques or social engineering, etc.</p>
    <p>External hackers or hacker groups: These hackers may launch targeted attacks on the systems of a water treatment
      plant to satisfy their individual or collective </p>
    <p>objectives, to gain access to sensitive information or to manipulate the system.</p>
    <p>(1) Objective: To gain control of the system, deliberately damage or blackmail the business.</p>
    <p>(2) Resources and skills: advanced cyber-attack techniques, malware development, social engineering skills, etc.
    </p>
    <p>Internal malicious persons: There may be internal employees or developers who try to use their privileges or
      knowledge to compromise the system or gain access to confidential information.</p>
    <p>(1) Objective: To sabotage the system, steal confidential information or violate regulations or deliberately
      damage the company's reputation.</p>
    <p>(2) Resources and skills: Insiders with system access, development knowledge and privileges who understand the
      vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the system.</p>
    <p>Professional Penetration Testers: These are professional penetration testers employed by a security agency or
      company to simulate the behaviour of an attacker to assess the security of a system.</p>
    <p>(1) Objective: To discover and report security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a system.</p>
    <p>(2) Resources and skills: Familiarity with a wide range of attack techniques and tools, and expertise in
      penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.</p>
    <li>In what ways could the system be attacked?</li>
    <p>(1) For each attack vector, have you identified a PnG (or could you add a PnG) capable of utilising that vector?
    </p>
    <p>Cyber attack: Hackers attacking systems through network intrusion, denial of service attacks or phishing attacks.
    </p>
    <p>PnG: Hackers, hackers, cybercriminal organisations, etc.</p>
    <p>Physical attacks: Attackers attack systems through physical intrusion, equipment damage or vandalism of
      facilities.</p>
    <p>PnG: Malicious staff, malicious visitors, vandals, etc.</p>
    <p>Social engineering: Attackers misbehave by tricking, disguising or luring personnel in order to gain access or
      sensitive information.</p>
    <p>PnG: social engineer, fraudster, mole, etc.</p>
  </ol>

  <h2>Step 3: Delete something in listed attacks. PnGs are unlikely or no realistic attack vectors could be identified
  </h2>
  <p>The following may be impractical PnG:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Competitors or business rivals: While competitors may attempt to gain access to sensitive information or disrupt
      operations, usually these actions are subject to legal and ethical constraints and do not resort to illegal means.
    </li>
    <li>Internal malicious persons: While internal employees may abuse their privileges or engage in illegal activities,
      most organisations have appropriate internal controls and monitoring mechanisms in place to mitigate such risks
      and can reduce many internal attacks.</li>
    <li>Professional Penetration Testers: Often bound by contract, such security experts or penetration testers are
      brought in with little chance of concealing company vulnerabilities and exploiting them maliciously.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Of the above attack vectors, the following may be difficult to identify:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Social engineering: Social engineering is the attacking of systems through deception and manipulation of human
      behaviour. This type of attack often exploits human weaknesses and is difficult to identify entirely by technical
      means. Staff need to be educated and trained to be more aware and alert to social engineering attacks.</li>
    <li>Advanced cyber attack techniques: Advanced cyber attack techniques often use new and unknown vulnerabilities or
      techniques, which make these attack vectors difficult to identify and stop by traditional security defences.
      Keeping up to date and adopting the latest security technologies and threat intelligence can help improve the
      identification of these attack vectors.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 4: Summarise the results from the above steps</h2>
  <p>Threat Participant Role:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>External hackers or hacktivist groups: These hackers may launch targeted attacks on the water treatment plant's
      systems to meet their individual or collective objectives, to gain access to sensitive information or to
      manipulate the system.</li>
    <p>Objective: Gain control of the system, deliberately damage or blackmail the business.</p>
    <p>Resources and skills: advanced cyber-attack techniques, malware development, social engineering skills, etc.</p>
    <li>Internal malicious personnel: There may be internal employees or developers who seek to use their privileges or
      knowledge to compromise systems or gain access to confidential information.</li>
    <p>Objective: To compromise systems, steal confidential information or breach regulations or deliberately damage the
      company's reputation.</p>
    <p>Resources and skills: Insiders with access to systems, development knowledge and privileges, knowledge of system
      vulnerabilities and weaknesses.</p>
  </ul>

  <p>Possible Attack Vectors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cyber attack: Hackers attacking systems through network intrusion, denial of service attacks or phishing
      attacks.</li>
    <p>PnG: Hackers, hackers, cybercriminal organisations, etc.</p>
    <li>Physical attacks: Attackers attack systems through physical intrusion, equipment damage or vandalism of
      facilities.</li>
    <p>PnG: Malicious staff, malicious visitors, vandals, etc.</p>
    <li>Social Engineering:Attackers misbehave by tricking, disguising or luring personnel in order to gain access or
      sensitive information.</li>
    <p>PnG: Social engineer, fraudster, mole, etc.</p>
  </ul>

  <p>summarise the results from the above steps，utilising tool support, as follow:</p>

  <p>a. Actor (PnG): Who or what instigates the attack?</p>
  <p>b. Purpose: What is the actor's goal or intent?</p>
  <p>c. Target: What asset is the target?</p>
  <p>d. Action: What action does the actor perform or attempt to perform? Here you should consider both the resources
    and the skills of the actor. You will also be describing HOW the actor might attack your system and its expansion
    into misuse cases.</p>
  <p>e. Result of the action: What happens as a result of the action? What assets are compromised? What goal has the
    actor achieved?</p>
  <p>f. Impact: What is the severity of the result (high, medium, or low)</p>
  <p>g. Threat type: (e.g., denial of service, spoofing)</p>
  <p>Answer:</p>
  <p>a. Actor (PnG): Who or what triggered the attack?</p>
  <p>External hacker or hacker group, Internal employee or developer</p>
  <p>b. Purpose: What is the attacker's goal or intent?</p>
  <p>To gain access to sensitive information, to manipulate a system, to satisfy an individual or collective goal
    Compromise a system, gain access to confidential information, abuse of privilege</p>
  <p>c. Target: What is the target of the attack?</p>
  <p>Water treatment plant systems and related assets (e.g. control systems, databases, servers, network equipment,
    etc.)</p>
  <p>d. Action: What action does the attacker perform or attempt to perform? The resources and skills of the attacker
    need to be considered here. You should also describe how the attacker might attack your system and extend to misuse
    cases.</p>
  <p>External hackers or hacktivist groups: use advanced cyber attack techniques such as network intrusion, denial of
    service attacks, phishing attacks, etc. to gain control of the system, steal sensitive information or compromise the
    system.
    Internal employees or developers: Use their privileges or knowledge, for example to abuse system access, develop
    backdoors, steal confidential information or compromise the configuration of the system.</p>
  <p>e. Result of the action: What is the result of the action? What assets were compromised? What objectives did the
    attacker achieve?</p>
  <p>Assets compromised: The integrity, availability and confidentiality of the system is threatened, which may result
    in equipment failure, data leakage, service disruption, system downtime, etc.
    Attacker achieves objectives: External hackers or hacktivist groups may succeed in obtaining sensitive information,
    manipulating systems or satisfying individual or collective goals; internal employees or developers may compromise
    systems, obtain confidential information or abuse privileges.</p>
  <p>f. Impact: What is the severity of the outcome?</p>
  <p>External hacker or hacker group: High</p>
  <p>Internal employee or developer: High (if the insider has access to all core information)</p>
  <p>Internal employee or developer: Medium (if the insider has access to some of the core information)</p>
  <p>Internal employee or developer: low (if insider does not have access to core information)</p>
  <p>g. Threat type: What is the threat type?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Physical attacks: e.g. power disruption and damage to critical facilities can lead to serious effects such as
      water outages and contaminated water sources.</li>
    <li>Internal employees: Information breaches may lead to consequences such as sensitive data leaks and system
      disruptions.</li>
    <li>Remote attacks: e.g. supply chain attacks, vulnerability attacks, social engineering attacks, denial of service
      attacks, which may lead to risks such as system downtime, data leakage and service disruption.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 5</h2>
  <p>After the preceding steps are done, you can continue with a formal risk assessment method, using these results, and
    the additional steps of a security requirements method.</p>
